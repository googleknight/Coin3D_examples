# Coin3D_examples
This repository uses Coin3D and SoWin libraries. This is a Microsoft Visual Studio Project. All necessary configurations are done in this project to run Coin3D and SoWin components. One may need to download compiled files from https://github.com/googleknight/Coin3D and place in C:\CoinDir.

This project contains some of the files that I created while learning Coin3D, SoWin API while interning at ONGC Dehradun.
